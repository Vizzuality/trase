Trase is committed to providing the best available data on global trade flows and associated 
information on the sustainability of commodity production and trade. The data used by Trase 
comprises a collection of publicly available logistics, trade, export, and customs data, combined
with social and environmental indicators from numerous sources. All of the data provided on 
Trase has been vetted for quality and accuracy. However, we are aware that some data may have 
limitations, even when coming from officially collected government sources. Trase will continue 
to improve the quality and accuracy of its data, and is committed to communicating these 
limitations transparently.

Portions of the data used in the SEI-PCS approach that underpins Trase have been purchased from 
other data providers, and carry restrictions on sharing in certain formats. In all cases, Trase 
respects relevant terms of use in its analysis and repackaging of data.
