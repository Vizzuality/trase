# Exporting CMS configuration

There are two ways to export the configuration data in a JSON format - using the CMS or programmatically via an API.

## Exporting using the CMS

The configuraton export dashboard is under [Database -> Configuration export](https://staging.trase.earth/content/admin/configuration_export).

If no export jub is currently running or queued, it is possible to start one using the `Start export` button.

Please refresh the page to check the progress of the job.

Status can be one of:
- QUEUED - added to the queue
- STARTED - now processing
- FINISHED - completed successfully
- FAILED - completed with errors

Once the job is finished, it is possible to download the JSON data.

## Exporting using the API

### Authentication

The API uses token authentication built using the `devise_token_auth` gem. The authentication endpoints are at `/api/private/auth`. [Here is the description of all endpoints provided by the gem](https://devise-token-auth.gitbook.io/devise-token-auth/usage), but we're only using `sign_in` / `sign_out`.

Sign in using the CMS email / password:

```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email":"xxx@xxx.xxx","password":"xxxxxxxx"}' -i https://staging.trase.earth/api/private/auth/sign_in
```

The response headers contain information needed to authenticate further requests:

```
access-token: XXX
token-type: Bearer
client: XXX
expiry: 1614725502
uid: xxx@xxx.xxx
```

To authenticate requests you need to pass the `uid`, `access-token`, `token-type` and `client` headers.

### Start export

To start a configuration export job use a POST request to `/api/private/configuration_export_events`.

```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '' -H "access-token:ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "uid:UID" -H "token-type:Bearer" -H "client:CLIENT" https://staging.trase.earth/api/private/configuration_export_events
```

This will return immediately, since it only schedules the job in the background processor.

```
{
  "data":{
    "id":5,
    "created_at":"2021-02-16T22:43:03.795Z",
    "updated_at":"2021-02-16T22:43:03.805Z",
    "status":"QUEUED",
    "jid":"44799594501793cdba36d543",
    "started_by":"xxx@xxx.xxx",
    "error":null,
    "data":null
  }
}
```

Use the `id` from the response body to check for the status of the job:

```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "access-token:ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "uid:UID" -H "token-type:Bearer" -H "client:CLIENT" https://staging.trase.earth/api/private/configuration_export_events/5
```

When status is FINISHED, `data` will contain the configuration exported in json format.
