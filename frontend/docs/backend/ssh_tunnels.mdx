## Running the importer in development
In case you need to connect to a remote database from a developer machine without direct access to the database server, you could open a tunnel through a remote host which has access.


In the following commands "database host" means the host on which main database sits, "remote host" means a host which has access to database host and through which we can tunnel the connection.

`ssh -L <local database port>:<database host>:<database port> <remote ssh username>@<remote host>`

The "local database port" can be set to any available local port, 5433 is usually fine.

To test the connection try this in another terminal window:

`psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5433 -U <database username> <database name>`

When connecting this way you have to set your `TRASE_REMOTE_HOST` to `127.0.0.1` and `TRASE_REMOTE_PORT` to `5433`.
