# Automatically generated documentation

## Database documentation

Schema documentation is generated directly from the database and requires the following steps:

1. The file `db/schema_comments.yml` contains documentation of schema objects, which is prepared in a way to easily insert it into the database schema itself using `COMMENT IS` syntax.
That is done using a dedicated rake task:

    `rake db:doc:sql`

    Note: this rake task also creates a new dump of structure.sql, as comments are part of the schema. Updating and regenerating the sql documentation should be done whenever we update the schema.
2. Once comments are in place, it is possible to generate html documentation of the database schema using an external tool. One of such tools is SchemaSpy, which is an open source java library.
    1. install [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
    2. install [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/)
    3. the [SchemaSpy](http://schemaspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) jar file and [PostgreSQL driver](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html) file are already in doc/db
    4. `rake db:doc:html`
    5. output files are in `doc/gh-pages/db/all_tables` (complete schema) and `doc/gh-pages/db/blue_tables` (only blue tables)
3. regenerating the html documentation and updating gh-pages is a part of the GH Actions build.


## Ruby code documentation

Not available throughout, but recommended for new code and refactoring. We use [YARD](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/yard/file/docs/GettingStarted.md)

## Swagger

We maintain swagger files in doc/gh-pages/api to document the internal and public APIs. Regenerating the html documentation and updating gh-pages is a part of the GH Actions build (using redoc).
