# Removing unused indexes

## Why would you even bother doing this?

When creating ActiveRecord tables using migrations, we take advantage of the `references` method to create foreign keys. By default an index is also created automatically in these cases. 

While often a good idea, the assumption being we will be using this column for joining tables, often indexes end up being unused and become a liability. They take up a lot of space needlessly and slow down table writes. Which is why it is good to review indexes.

## How to detect unused indexes?

1. Identify relevant environments from which to get statistics

  - production (environment with most reliable data for API queries)
  - sandbox (environment with most reliable data for data uploader and validation queries)
  - in case of features which had not been release to production yet, the environment where they are actively tested (e.g. dashboardsdemo for dashboards queries)

2. Retrieve lists of potentially unused indexes from all relevant environments

  ```
SELECT s.schemaname,
       s.relname AS tablename,
       s.indexrelname AS indexname,
       pg_relation_size(s.indexrelid) AS index_size
FROM pg_catalog.pg_stat_user_indexes s
   JOIN pg_catalog.pg_index i ON s.indexrelid = i.indexrelid
WHERE s.idx_scan = 0      -- has never been scanned
  AND 0 <>ALL (i.indkey)  -- no index column is an expression
  AND NOT i.indisunique   -- is not a UNIQUE index
  AND NOT EXISTS          -- does not enforce a constraint
         (SELECT 1 FROM pg_catalog.pg_constraint c
          WHERE c.conindid = s.indexrelid)
ORDER BY pg_relation_size(s.indexrelid) DESC;
```

  Note: you can also use the maintenance.unused_indexes view.

3. Prepare files

  Save those lists in files, e.g. `production.txt`, `sandbox.txt`, `dashboardsdemo.txt`. For comparisons, the size of the index should be removed from the file (as this can differ between environments).

4. Find the common ones

  Using a combination of `sort` and `comm` you can get the list of indexes which appear to be unused in all environments:

  ````
comm -12 <(sort production.txt) <(sort sandbox.txt) > tmp.txt
comm -12 <(sort dashboardsdemo.txt) <(sort tmp.txt) > unused_indexes.txt
```

5. Use your judgement

  The statistics can be misleading. Don't automatically remove indexes which you suspect are used very rarely, but when they are they make a massive difference. Evaluate those separately.

  In most cases indexes which have a small size can be removed safely; if the index is small, that means the table is small and the planner will go for a sequential scan over an index anyway.

## How to remove indexes?

Use `remove_index` in one of its 2 forms:

- `remove_index(table_name, column: column_names)` - if you're sure you don't have indexes defined on same columns with different names (e.g. expression indexes or partial indexes)
- `remove_index(table_name, name: index_name)` - otherwise


For example:

```
index = {
  table: 'table name',
  columns: 'column name' OR ['column 1 name', 'column 2 name'],
  name: 'index name'
}
```

```
if index_exists?(index[:table], index[:columns], name: index[:name])
  remove_index index[:table], name: index[:name]
end
```

The `if` is a precaution, in case any of the environments had been modified manually.
