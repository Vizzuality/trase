# Database objects naming conventions

Please observe the following naming conventions used in Trase.

## Table names

Names should normally be plural, especially when accessed via AR models.

## Partitioned table names

Same as for other tables in case of the parent. Partitions should be called

```
  <name of parent table>\_<value of partition key>.
```

## View names

Same as for tables, but with \_v suffix.

## Materialised view names

Same as for tables, but with \_mv suffix.

## Index names

```
  <name of table>\_<underscore separated list of index columns>\_idx
```

These kinds of names are typically shorter that the default Rails-generated names. However, in case the name still goes over the limit, instead of enumerating the columns involved in the index we go for a descriptive name, e.g. xxx\_grouping\_idx.
