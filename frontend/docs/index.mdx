# Trase

[Trase](http://trase.earth) brings unprecedented transparency to commodity supply chains revealing new pathways towards achieving a deforestation-free economy.

<img src="public/trase-screenshot.png" alt="Trase image" width="800"/>

## Project structure

This repository contains the source code for the website in two technically independent applications:
- `/frontend` contains the frontend application, including a dedicated nodejs server (for dev purposes only);
- `/` contains the Rails 5.x API that serves data to the above mentioned frontend application.

While technically independent, the frontend application is heavily dependent on the API spec served by the rails application.

## Requirements

### API
- Ruby 2.6.3 and RubyGems (recommended installation via rvm)
- [Bundler](http://bundler.io/)
- PostgreSQL 11 with `intarray`, `tablefunc` and `postgres_fdw` extensions
- redis >= 4.1.0
- go 1.14 (for mbtile server)
- wget
- cron

### Frontend
- Nodejs 8.2+

## Local setup

### API

We recommend managing your Ruby installation through [rvm](https://github.com/rvm/rvm). Ensure `bundler` gem is installed.

1. Install ruby libraries

    `bundle install`

2. Configure the environment

    Copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and replace the values accordingly. See the Configuration section below for more information.

3. Create the database

    Create an empty database in PostgreSQL and then [import a stable database version](docs-backend-data-export-import). If it's an earlier version than the current schema, run the migrations:

    `rake db:migrate`

4. Start the API

    `rails server`

5. Start background job processing

- `redis-server`
- `bundle exec sidekiq`

### Frontend

1. `cd` into the `frontend` folder

2. Copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and replace the values accordingly. See the Configuration section below for more information.

3. Install dependencies: Don't use npm, install yarn if needed (https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install)

    `yarn install`


4. Start the development server

    `yarn start`

## Configuration

The project's main configuration values can be set using [environment variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) in the `.env` file.

```

If you are using the included development server, you can set those variables in the `.env` file (use the included `.env.sample` as an example)

## Tests

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Vizzuality/trase.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Vizzuality/trase)

We use jest and puppeteer for the end to end tests. There are some mocks for the requests in the puppeteer/mocks folder. Every slash (/) and params (? &) are replaced by a hyphen in the file name. i.e:
api-v3-contexts-year-2015 will mock api/v3/contexts?year=2015

The tests have to be run while the js server is running

Run all tests with:
```
yarn test
```

Run only unit tests:
```
yarn unit
```

Run only end to end:
```
yarn e2e
```

We are using Puppeteer-Jest for the End to end tests, also [Polly](https://netflix.github.io/pollyjs) to record and replay stub interactions.
The recorded interactions will be saved in the recordings folder inside tests. In the future we might want to make a script to remove this folder when we want to update them.
Right now we can do it manually.
Also we are using [Puppeteer recorder](https://github.com/checkly/puppeteer-recorder) to record the actions and translate them into code. In the configuration specify the 'data-test' custom data attribute and use it in every element that you want to use.

To update image snapshots due to changes in the page and if test is failing:

```
yarn e2e -- -u
```

### API

```
RAILS_ENV=test rake db:drop db:create db:structure:load
bundle exec rspec spec
```

You may also want to know about API [gold master tests](docs-backend-gold-master-tests) and [load tests](docs-backend-load-tests).

### Frontend

Running `yarn test` will launch jest testing environment and run all tests that match `*.test.js` filename inside the `frontend/scripts` folder.

## Deployment

We use [Capistrano](http://capistranorb.com/) as a deployment tool, which deploys both API and frontend application simultaneously.

To deploy, simply use:

```
cap <staging|production> deploy
```

## Sitemaps

We are using [Sitemap generator](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator).
The sitemap config is located in config/sitemap.rb.
To refresh the sitemap and ping Google and Bing bots use:

```
rake sitemap:refresh
```
To do it without pinging the bots:
```
rake sitemap:refresh:no_ping
```

The sitemap is refreshed automatically in each release.

## Git hooks

This project includes a set of git hooks that you may find useful
- Run `bundle install` when loading `Gemfile.lock` modifications from remotes
- Run `yarn install` when loading `frontend/package.json` modifications from remotes
- Receive a warning when loading `.env.sample` or `frontend/.env.sample` modifications from remotes
- Run `Rubocop` and `JS Lint` before committing

To enable then, simply execute once: `bin/git/init-hooks`

#### Links and Nodes flow for the tool

Links in the sankey are requested on the getToolLinksData fetch saga (flows endpoint)
The links are filtered by the selected node which is imported as an expanded node from the nodesPanel (see getExpandedAndExcludedNodes in nodes-panel.selectors)
This links contain the nodes on their path attribute and we fetch these nodes information afterwards to be able to show it (getToolNodesByLink)
