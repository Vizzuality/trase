# Map

The maps on the application are based on react-simple-maps (Explore page - WorldMap component) and mapbox + layer manager (Tool - Map component), leaflet + layer manager (Logistics map).
Two different versions of Layer Manager (an open-sourced vizzuality tool) coexist to allow leaflet to be used on the Logistics map.

## Add new vector layers to service

This is needed when an update is needed on the map's vector layers. We have a service on the backend to serve this layers for the mapbox tool page map. See mbtileserver backend documentation.

- Generate tiles from carto into a mbtiles file
- IMPORTANT: layers should be named like [COUNTRY]_[SINGULAR_NODE_TYPE].mbtiles e.g ecuador_cantons.mbtiles This will help to automatically select the unit layer on the map component. It won't be loaded if it doesn't have the correct name. Also the source layer should be the capitalised country e.g. Ecuador
- Generated tiles should be in /var/www/tilesets
- Use scp to upload the generated *.mbtiles into this folder of sandbox-data or production:
```
scp ./ecuador_cantons.mbtiles ubuntu@sandbox-data.trase.earth:/var/www/tilesets
```
- ssh to sandbox-data or production
- Run the following command to restart the mbtileserver:
```
sudo systemctl restart mbtileserver
```

The most up to date version of the tiles is stored on the map folder but this is not used on the app directly. Is just to have a back-up
