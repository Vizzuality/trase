    This is a first version of the public API for [Trase](https://trase.earth/).


    # Introduction


    The Trase Public API allows to access trade flows data of forest risk commodities.


    # Entities


    The API will expose the following entities present in Trase:

    1. attributes: quantitative and qualitative attributes (indicators)

    2. commodities: forest risk commodities

    3. countries: source countries for commodities

    4. flows: models the list of nodes in a supply chain (path) from source to destination

    5. nodes: entities participating in the supply chain. Each has a "node type", e.g. MUNICIPALITY, EXPORTER, but they are also grouped in the system by a more generic "role":
      a. sources: source nodes, such as municipalities in Brazil or departments in Paraguay
      b. traders: exporters / importers of commodities
      c. destinations: destination nodes, such as importing countries
    6. node types: the roles of nodes at particular positions in supply chains per country / commodity combination


    # Discovering node identifiers


    We assume one of the typical scenarios is one where the point of entry into the data will be a source, an exporter, an importer or a destination. All of these entities are nodes, but int Trase we group them by "role" in the supply chain.


    In the first step, users would use the sources / exporters / importers / destinations endpoints, which allow to discover the identifiers of entities by searching by name and existing natural identifiers (e.g. iso code). For now we need to work around the fact that nodes in the system don't have standardised identifiers, which would allow to skip this step.


    Those endpoints will also allow to discover the availability of indicators. Then in the next step users can use those identifiers to pull data for a particular node.


    # Retrieving attribute values


    It is possible to retrieve full flows data using the flows endpoint.


    It is also possible to retrieve data filtered by a particular node, which includes both values of attributes for flows in which the node participates (flow attributes), as well as values of some attributes which are not calculated from flows (node attributes).


    # Sample usage - retrieving flow data for country / commodity


    Use the commodities endpoint to discover identifiers of available commodities. You can also at the same time retrieve ids of countries from which the commodities are sourced.


    /api/public/commodities?include=countries


    Countries can be retireved using the countries endpoint.


    Now using the attributes endpoint, find out what sttributes are available for Brazil beef:


    /api/public/attributes?commodity=BEEF&country=BR


    Volume data is available for years 2015-2017. Request flows data for 2016-2017:


    /api/public/flows?commodity=BEEF&country=BR&start_year=2016&end_year=2017&page=1


    Data is paginated.


    # Sample usage - retrieving data about a node


    Discover the identifier of the sourcing place.


    /api/public/nodes/sources?country=BR&commodity=BEEF&name=SORRISO


    Data is available for years 2003-2017. Request data for 2017:


    /api/public/nodes/{id of SORRISO}/data?year=2017
