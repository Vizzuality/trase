    This is a DRAFT version 1.1 of the public API for [Trase](http://supplychains.trase.earth).

    # Introduction


    The Trase Public API allows access to trade flow data of the forest risk commodities hosted in Trase’s database. For a list of available commodities and country contexts please refer to the documentation on the Trase homepage: https://supplychains.trase.earth/about


    # Entities


    The API will expose the following entities present in Trase:

    1. attributes: quantitative and qualitative attributes associated with Trase data. These include, for example our flagship indicators for deforestation risk, along with other metrics relevant to social and environmental risk

    2. commodities: the forest risk commodities covered by the Trase database

    3. countries: source countries for commodities covered by the Trase database

    4. flows: provides the list of nodes in a supply chain (path) from source to destination

    5. nodes: provides entities participating in the supply chain. Each has a "node type" (see below), e.g. MUNICIPALITY, EXPORTER, but they are also grouped in the system by a more generic "role" as follows:

        a. sources: source nodes, such as municipalities in Brazil or departments in Paraguay

        b. traders: exporters or importers of commodities

        c. destinations: destination nodes, such as importing countries
    6. node types: the types of nodes at particular positions in supply chains per country / commodity combination


    # Discovering node identifiers


    A typical scenario for API use is likely to be one where the point of entry into the data will be a commodity source, an exporter, an importer or a destination. All of these entities are nodes, but in Trase we group them by "role" in the supply chain.


    As a first step, users would therefore use the sources / exporters / importers / destinations endpoints, which allow discovery of the identifiers of entities by searching by name and existing natural identifiers (e.g. ISO code). At this stage, nodes in the Trase system do not have standardised identifiers, so this first step is necessary to allow cross-referencing of nodes against the points of interest from a user-perspective.


    Accessing information via these endpoints will also allow the user to discover the availability of indicators associated with these nodes. In the following step, users can use those identifiers to pull data for a particular node.


    # Retrieving attribute values


    It is possible to retrieve full flow data using the flows endpoint.


    It is also possible to retrieve data filtered by a particular node, which includes both values of attributes for flows in which the node participates (flow attributes), as well as values of some attributes which are not calculated from flows but are specific to the nodes themselves (node attributes).


    # Sample usage - retrieving flow data for country / commodity


    Use the commodities endpoint to discover identifiers of available commodities. At the same time, you can also retrieve ids of countries from which the commodities are sourced.


    /api/public/commodities?include=countries


    Countries can be retrieved using the countries endpoint.
    
    
    /api/public/countries?include=commodities


    Now by using the attributes endpoint, it is possible to find out what attributes are available for Brazil beef:


    /api/public/attributes?commodity=BEEF&country=BR


    Volume data is available for years 2015-2017 and it is possible to select particular years using the API. For example, to request data for 2016-2017:


    /api/public/flows?commodity=BEEF&country=BR&start_year=2016&end_year=2017&page=1


    Data is paginated.


    # Sample usage - retrieving data about a node


    Discover the identifier of the sourcing place.


    /api/public/nodes/sources?country=BR&commodity=BEEF&name=SORRISO


    Data is available for years 2003-2017. Request data for 2017 using the id number of the node of interest (e.g. the id of SORRISO is 11113):


    /api/public/nodes/11113/data?year=2017
